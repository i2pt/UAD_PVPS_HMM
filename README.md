## Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Peripheral Venous Pressure Signals with Hidden Markov Models

- This repository contains the codes of the paper 'Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Peripheral Venous Pressure Signals with Hidden Markov Models'. 
- To be published in [Biomedical Signal Processing and Control](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/biomedical-signal-processing-and-control) (currently under second review)
- (Till now) We have decided not to publish the dataset used in this study.
